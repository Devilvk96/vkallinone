# Introduction 

This is the file containing local state file and remote state file links of day2 terraform with AWS.

## What is ``Terraform``?

- Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources safely and efficiently.

- HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## What is ``local state file`` in Terraform?

- A local state file in Terraform, refers to the file that stores the state information of your infrastructure within the same directory as your Terraform configuration files. The state file keeps track of the mapping between the resources in your Terraform configuration and the real-world infrastructure they represent.

## What is ``remote state file`` in Terraform?

- A remote state file in Terraform,  refers to storing the state information of your infrastructure in a remote location rather than in the same directory as your Terraform configuration files. The state file contains information about the resources managed by Terraform, such as resource IDs, metadata, and other details needed to keep track of the infrastructure's state.
