## *This page lists default port numbers associated with various Docker images.*


# Introduction 

A **Default port** number is a predefined numeric value that is associated with a specific network service or protocol. It serves as a standardized entry point for communication between devices or applications over a network, such as the internet. Default port numbers are used to ensure that different software components can communicate with each other effectively without needing to negotiate port numbers each time.

|DockerImage|   Default Port      |Description|
|-------|-----------|------|
|**Nginx**|**Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS)** |Nginx uses **Port 80** for handling unencrypted HTTP traffic, and **Port 443** for secure, encrypted HTTPS traffic. Port 80 is the default for standard web browsing, while Port 443 is used to ensure data privacy and security during web communication.|   
|**MySQL**|**Port 3306**|MySQL uses **Port 3306** as its default communication channel. This port facilitates connections between MySQL client applications and the MySQL server, allowing for database queries and data retrieval. |
|**PostgreSQL**|**Port 5432**|PostgreSQL, a popular open-source relational database system, uses **Port 5432** as its default communication port. Applications and clients connect to this port to interact with PostgreSQL databases over a network. It's essential to configure firewalls and network settings to allow traffic on **Port 5432** for PostgreSQL to function properly.|
|**Redis**|**Port 6379**|Redis, a popular in-memory data store, uses **Port 6379** as its default port for client-server communication. It allows applications to connect and store/retrieve data, making it a widely-used choice for caching and real-time data processing. |
|**MongoDB**|**Port 27017**| **Port 27017** is the default network port used by MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database system, for client-server communication. It serves as the entry point for applications to connect and interact with the MongoDB database. |
|**SSH**|**Port 22**|SSH (Secure Shell) uses **Port 22** as its default communication channel on a network. It provides secure remote access and command-line control over a computer or server. **Port 22** is essential for establishing encrypted and authenticated connections for secure remote administration.|
|**Jenkins**|**Port 8080**|Jenkins, a popular automation server, uses **Port 8080** as its default communication channel. This port is where the Jenkins web interface is typically accessible, allowing users to manage and configure automation pipelines and jobs through a web browser. Administrators can customize this port if necessary.|
|**SonarQube**|**HTTP Port 9000**| SonarQube, a code quality and security analysis tool, utilizes **Port 9000** as its default HTTP port. This port is where the SonarQube web interface is accessible, enabling users to perform code analysis and review reports via a web browser. Administrators can modify this port as needed. |
|**Node.js**|**Port 3000**| Node.js applications typically use **Port 3000** as the default port for web server communication. This port serves as the entry point for handling HTTP requests and responses in Node.js web applications. Developers can customize this port to suit their application's requirements.|
|**Azure Cosmos DB**|**Port 10255**|Azure Cosmos DB uses **Port 10255** as its default listening port. This port is commonly associated with the DocumentDB API, allowing applications to interact with Azure Cosmos DB using the SQL API. When configuring network settings or firewall rules for Azure Cosmos DB, ensure that port 10255 is open to enable communication with the service.|
|**MariaDB**|**Port 3306**|MariaDB uses **Port 3306** as the default port number. This port is the standard entry point for database connections to MariaDB servers. It facilitates the communication between client applications and the MariaDB database server, allowing for data retrieval and manipulation.|
|**Cassandra**|**Port 9042**| Cassandra uses **Port 9042** as the default port number. It serves as the main communication port for the Cassandra database, allowing clients to connect and interact with the database cluster. Administrators and developers typically configure clients to use this port for data operations.|
|**Kibana**|**Port 5601**|Kibana uses **Port 5601** as the default port. This port is where the Kibana web interface is accessible, allowing users to visualize and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch for monitoring and analysis purposes. Administrators can configure this port to suit their network requirements if necessary.|
|**Git**|**Port 9418**|Git uses **Port 9418** as the default port, which is a lightweight network protocol for Git version control system. It facilitates read-only access to Git repositories, commonly used for public access to open-source projects. Git clients connect to this port to clone repositories via the Git protocol.|
|**Prometheus**|**Port 9090**|Prometheus default **Port 9090** is used for accessing the Prometheus monitoring and alerting system's web interface. It allows users to query and visualize collected metrics and configure alerting rules. This port is crucial for managing and monitoring Prometheus metrics and alerts.|
|**etcd (Distributed Key-Value Store)**|**Port 2379**|Etcd, a distributed key-value store, uses **Port 2379** as its default communication channel. It plays a crucial role in distributed systems for configuration management, service discovery, and coordination by storing and providing access to configuration and metadata information across a cluster of machines. **Port 2379** is the standard entry point for applications and clients to interact with etcd clusters, ensuring reliable and consistent data storage and retrieval.|
|**Neo4j**|**Port 7688**|Neo4j, when configured for Bolt SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections, uses a default **Port 7688**. This port facilitates encrypted communication between clients and the Neo4j graph database, ensuring secure data transfer.
